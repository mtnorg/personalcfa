When developing a Node.js command-line interface (CLI) tool, having a well-organized folder structure can contribute to the maintainability and clarity of your project. Below is a suggested folder structure for a Node.js CLI tool:

```
cli/
|-- bin/
|   |-- your-cli-tool          # Entry point script
|
|-- lib/                       # Core functionality of the CLI
|   |-- commands/              # Individual command modules
|       |-- command1.js
|       |-- command2.js
|       |-- ...
|   |-- config/                # Configuration files or modules
|   |-- utils/                 # Utility functions
|   |-- your-cli-tool.js       # Main CLI module
|
|-- test/                      # Unit tests
|   |-- commands/              # Test files for commands
|   |-- lib/                   # Test files for core functionality
|
|-- .gitignore
|-- .eslintrc
|-- .prettierrc
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
|-- tsconfig.json
```

Explanation of each folder:

**bin/:** This folder contains the executable script that serves as the entry point for your CLI tool. It's the script that users will run from the command line.

**lib/:** This folder houses the core functionality of your CLI tool. It's further organized into subfolders:

**commands/:** Contains individual modules for each command supported by your CLI tool. Each command module should export a function or object representing the command logic.

**config/:** Holds configuration files or modules. Depending on the complexity of your CLI tool, you may need to store configuration settings in a centralized location.

**utils/:** Contains utility functions that may be shared across different parts of your CLI tool.

**your-cli-tool.js:** The main module that orchestrates the CLI tool. It may include logic for parsing command-line arguments, handling configuration, and invoking specific commands.

**test/:** This folder is for unit tests. It mirrors the structure of the lib/ folder, with subfolders for testing commands and core functionality. Use a testing framework such as Mocha or Jest.

**.gitignore:** This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by version control. Common entries include node_modules/ and \*.log.

**package.json:** The standard Node.js package configuration file. It includes metadata about your project, dependencies, and scripts.

**README.md:** A documentation file providing information about your CLI tool, its purpose, usage, and any other relevant details.

**tsconfig.json:** The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

**.eslintrc:** This .eslintrc file is used for the purpose of improving code quality, making code more consistent, and avoiding bugs
